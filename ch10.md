## The getline Function

The **getline** function is similar to awk's **next** statement. While both cause the next input line to be read, the **next** statement passes control back to the top of the script. The **getline** function gets the next line without changing control in the script.

The **getline** function allows you to read input from a file of a pipe.

```getline < "data"```

The **getline** function allows you to assign the input record to a variable. Thus the following statement reads the next line of input into the variable **input**

```getline input```

You; can execute a command and pipe the output into **getline**.

```"who am i" | getline```


The **close()** function allows you to close open files and pipes.

The **system()** function executes a command supplied as an expression.
