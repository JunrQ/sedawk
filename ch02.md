# Ch02 Understanding Basic Operations

```shell

sed -f scriptfile inputfile

```

* In sed and awk, each instruction has two parts: a *pattern* and a *procedure*. The pattern is a regular expression dlimited with slashed (/). A procedure specified one or more actions to be performed.

```shell
# sed [-e] 'instruction' file
# -e option is necessary only when you supply more than one instruction on the command line.
# It tells sed to interpret the next argument as an instruction.

sed 's/MA/Massachusetts/' list # s replace MA into Massachusetts

```

* Three ways to specify multiple instructions on the command line

```shell
# semicolon
sed 's/ MA/, Massachusetts/; s/ PA/, Pennsylvania/' list

# -e
sed -e  's/ MA/, Massachusetts/' -e 's/ PA/, Pennsylvania/' list

# Use the multiline entry capability of the Bourne shell.
sed '
s/ MA/, Massachusetts/
s/ PA/, Pennsylvania/' list

```

The `-n` option suppresses the automatic output. When specifying the option, each instruction intended to produce must contain a point command, **p**.

* **awk**

```
awk 'instructions' files

awk -f script files
```

awk interprets each input as a record and each word on that line, delimited by spaces or tabs, as a field. $0 represents the entire input line. $1, $2, ...refer to the individual fields on the input line.

```shell
# $1 refers to the value of the first field on each input line
awk '{print $1}' list

# a pattern /MA/ is pecified but there is no procedure. The default action is to print each line that matches the pattern
awk '/MA/' list


# The -F option change the field separator
awk -F, '/MA/ {print $1}' list
```
