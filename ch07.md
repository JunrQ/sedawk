# Writing Scipts for awk

## Awk's Programming Model

An awk program consists of what we will call a *main input loop*. A *loop* is a routine that is executed over and over again until some condition exists that terminates it.

You can think of an awk script as having potentially three major parts: what happens before, what happens during, and what happens after processing the input.

```shell
# The system variable FS can bu defined to change the
# field separator. Because this must be done before the
# first input line is read, we must assign this variable
# in an action controlled by the BEGIN rule.

BEGIN {FS = ","}

# The tilde ~ operator allows you to test a regular expression against a field
$5 ~ /MA/ {print $1 ", " $6}
# Reverse, match all those records whose fifth field did not have "MA" in it
$5 !~ /MA/ {print $1 ", " $6}

```

## Expressions

```shell
# Count blank lines
/^$/ {
  print x += 1
}
END {
  print x
}

```

* FS  field separator
* OFS output field separator
* NF  number of fields
* RS  record separator
* ORS
* NR  number of current input record
* FILENAME  the name of the current input file
* CONVFMT   used to control number-to-string conversions

## Formatted Printing

`printf(format-expression[, arguments])`

%-width.precision format-specifier

## Passing parameters Into a Script

`awk 'script' var=value inputfile`

An important restriction on command-line parameters it that they are not available in the **BEGIN** procedure.
