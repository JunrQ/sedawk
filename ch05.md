# Ch05 Basic sed Commands

```shell
# Sed script

# The first command can be placed on the same line with
# opening brace but the closing brace must appear on its own line
address {
  command1
  command2
  command3
}


# One subtle syntax error is adding a space after a command
# This is not allowed; the end of a command line must be
# at the end of line.

```
